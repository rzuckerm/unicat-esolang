# unicat-esolang

Python 3 Port of Unicat Esoteric Language created by [gemdude64](https://github.com/gemdude46/unicat).
See this [Sample Programs in Every Language](https://sampleprograms.io/)
[article](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/unicat/) for a description of the language.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or later

## Installing or Updating

This package has no dependencies, so it is safe to do this:

```
pip install --user -U esocat-lang
```

However, if you want to install this is in virtualenv, you can do this once
you have activated the virtualenv:

```
pip install -U esocat-lang
```

## Usage

Use this to run your Unicat program:

```
unicat [-d/--debug] FILENAME
```

where:

* `-d` or `--debug` enables debugging
* `FILENAME` is the path to the Unicat program

## Debugging

When `unicat` is run with `-d` or `--debug`, the python debugger is entered
before each instruction. The first time, a welcome screen is displayed:

```
Welcome to the Unicat debugger

Here are the commands:

- show_ins()           - Show instructions
- show_mem()           - Show all memory
- show_mem(start)      - Show memory address `<start>`
- show_mem(start, end) - Show memory address `<start>` to `<end>`
- c                    - Execute next instruction

Everything else is just a pdb command.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html for details.

```

When the debugger is entered, the current instruction is displayed. For
example:

```
Current instruction:
Address 0 (0o0): asgnlit 0 (0o0), 72 (0o110 = 'H')
> ...execute_instructions()
-> if it[0] == "diepgrm":
```

## Examples

Example programs can be found [here](https://github.com/rzuckerm/unicat-esolang/tree/main/examples).
These programs are also used for unit testing the Unicat language
implementation.
